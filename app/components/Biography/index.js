        {'Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Rhetoric and Composition at Florida State University. I completed my Masters in Rhetoric and Composition at Miami University (Ohio) in 2015. I received my BA in English Literature from University of Central Florida in 2013. My research interests include collaborative writing, writing centers, and disability. I identify as disabled and work with my service dog, Rosie. She is a sassy, strong willed Great Pyrenees. Presently, I am the Coordinator for FSUâ€™s Reading Writing Center, and I teach courses related to composition and peer tutoring at FSU.'}

        {'When I\'m not focusing on my research and teaching, I enjoy fostering animals through the Leon County Humane Society. In the past two years, I\'ve fostered and found homes for over 20 cats and dogs. I also find joy in caring for my own pets, which includes a dog (Maple), two cats (Clint and Grayson), and five chickens.'}
