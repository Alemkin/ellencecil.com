        As a white, disabled woman I am aware of both my privilege and marginalized identity as I strive to
        continue learning more about diversity and become a strong advocate. Acknowledging and accounting for
        diversity is central to my pedagogy, but my desire to embrace and support a diverse student body also informs
        my scholarship. My scholarship primarily focuses on creating more equitable classroom spaces and
        professional environments, with a particular emphasis on disability. For example, I have an upcoming article
        being published in College Composition and Communication that addresses creating more accessible
        conference spaces. The work that I do with disability, however, often intersects with other marginalized
        identities and working towards equity in this area often results in more accessible spaces for all. As such, I am
        committed to promoting and seeking out opportunities to support diversity in my profession and courses.

      Throughout my academic career, I have endeavored to promote diversity on both a national and
      campus level. Nationally, I have promoted diversity initiatives as a member of the Writing Program
      Administration – Graduate Organization (WPA-GO). In both the Diversity and Outreach Committee and the
      Accessibility Committee, I worked with members to organize events and draft position statements to support
      diversity initiatives. Currently, I am drafting a position statement with the Accessibility Committee, which calls
      for conference organizers to attend to issues of disability and accessibility. On a campus level, I am currently
      an Ambassador with the Office of Accessibility Services, a role that promotes disability visibility and
      acceptance on campus. This semester, I am developing a mentoring program between disabled graduate and
      undergraduate students with aspirations of attending graduate programs. During my master’s program, I was
      a graduate administrator for the Study of the United States Institute for Student Leaders (SUSI). SUSI brought
      undergraduate international students from north Africa to the States to study civic engagement for an
      intensive, immersive six-week long program alongside local students. As an administrator, I helped the local
      and international students navigate competing cultural values and foster understanding and care amongst all
      participants. I found this work to be both stimulating and rewarding as the students learned to appreciate and
      respectfully challenge each other’s perspectives. In each of these roles, I’ve learned that fostering diversity is
      often a slow-moving process that takes dedication from multiple stakeholders and a willingness to listen to
      and honor a variety of perspectives.

      As an instructor, I always assume that my courses will be comprised of a diverse range of students from
      different privileged and marginalized identities and backgrounds. I account for my students’ varied
      experiences in a multitude of ways and attend to them even before the first day of class. On my syllabi,
      students will find that two of the first things I address include a statement of inclusion and my commitment to
      making my classroom accessible. I want my students to know that even before they meet me, I am excited to
      teach them, regardless of their histories or abilities, and that I will strive to create an inclusive classroom
      space. On the first day of class, I always continue this work by paying careful attention to students’ preferred
      names, pronunciation, pronouns, and accommodations. These endeavors towards equity continue throughout
      the semester as I introduce and teach a variety of course appropriate diversity topics. For example, when
      addressing document design, I often develop students’ awareness of disabled audience members and teach
      simple strategies they can employ to create more inclusive texts. I am committed to deepening my
      understanding of the lived experiences of my students and colleagues in order to create more equitable
      classroom and professional environments through my scholarship and pedagogy.
