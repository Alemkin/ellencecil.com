          <p>
            {'When I first starting teaching ENC 2135, I was terrified. Sure, I had two years of teaching under my belt, but I had never taught a course that focused on genre as its underlying principle. I knew a little bit about genre as a general concept, but I wasn’t convinced that I could teach a semester-long course on it. These concerns led me to believe that I was going to fail. But, I was wrong. Instead, I found myself falling in love with teaching ENC 2135. ENC 2135 offers me the opportunity to enact pedagogy I’m passionate about as well as teach a subject matter that I’m deeply invested in. The affordances allowed in ENC 2135 provides me the opportunity to structure my classroom with a student centered pedagogy, which I believe, leads to successful student learning.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'Looking back, it seems a bit strange to me that I had anxiety over teaching ENC 2135; especially when I aim to cultivate a classroom environment that promotes failure. Productive failure, that is.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'Let me explain. I became interested in the concept of failure as a learning tool after I had my own experience of failure the first time I tried to teach a class. My former first year composition professor, Adele Richardson, had been kind enough to allow me to observe her class the summer before I would start teaching my own. She offered me the opportunity to teach one of the lessons to the class, and I immediately accepted. However, the lesson ended up a mess: the students were bored, unresponsive (except for a few eye rolls), and didn’t understand the material I was presenting. Adele had to swoop in and save the lesson. Instead of becoming disheartened, I started thinking about the ways that I could have improved the lesson and ways that I could encourage student engagement. After some serious reflection, I realized that I had learned and thought more deeply about this instance of failure than I had ever in any of my instances of success. I came to understand and conceptualize failure not as something bad, but as a first attempt in learning. Failure has the potential to facilitate learning in ways that success never can.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'How does this translate into a classroom where students often conceptualize the work that they do as high stakes? This is a serious issue to consider because at a macro level the stakes are high: their success or failure can help or hinder them when it comes to obtaining a job or graduate admission. However, on a day-to-day basis, I attempt dismantle the high stakes nature of getting an A by providing them with low stakes activities where failure is an acceptable option. I do this by scaffolding my assignments and proving in-class work which allows students to try out the various concepts before receiving a grade on them. One of my former students wrote about her experience with these activities: “I liked Ms. Cecil’s teaching style in that she had us do an activity or assignment related to the concept we had to understand before we ever had to apply the concept in graded work. Because of this teaching style, I feel as though I understand the course material very well. Ms. Cecil is also a very knowledgeable and understanding professor, I enjoyed having her for this course.”'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'Another way that I encourage productive failure is by allowing students to revise final drafts of their assignments. The revision process I outline for my students involves a three step process: 1) meeting with me to discuss their original draft, 2) attend a consultation at the RWC, and 3) submit revised draft with reflection on their writing. During the initial meeting, I work with the students to discuss the feedback I gave them on their drafts, answer questions they have, and finally devise a revision plan. Students leave the meeting feeling confident in their revision process—rather than stressed out by their original grade. I have my students attend a conference at the RWC after they’ve had some time to work on their draft so they can get a second reader’s opinion on their work. I find that my students benefit by having someone to work with who may explain writing concepts in a different perspective than I do. Finally, their reflection on their revision has my students cement the learning they gained from the revision by articulating their processes.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'Although I don’t have any responses from my students directly commenting on their experiences during the revisions process, I have had two students speak to the quality of response and assistance I give them on their writing. The first student wrote, “The instructor did a good job of writing responses and helping each student figure out how they could personally develop their writing style.” Here, my student articulated that I help each student cultivate their writing through my responses. The second student spoke to my ability to help students think through their writing: “I like that Ms. Cecil was very available when it came to her office hours. She was always willing to sit down with me and got me out of a rut on a few of my assignments.” These responses speak to my ability to develop student writers through thoughtful feedback and one-on-one meetings.'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'Another way that I encourage my students to learn is through collaboration. Collaboration plays a key part of my students’ learning and failing process. I frequently use small groups (three to four students) to create a collaborative learning environment. As such, students begin to form strong communities within and outside of the classroom. Having a strong sense of community within the classroom, especially one that fosters collaborative learning, is critical to the success of the class. As such, I work in community building activities in each class meeting. One of the ways I do this is by asking a question to take attendance. I keep attendance fun and light by asking questions such as “What do you order when you go to Taco Bell?” and “If you could travel to any fictional realm, where would you go?” Students really appreciate these questions and often comment on them in the course evaluations. One student wrote, “I liked the attendance questions we had to answer at the start of each class. They made me feel like I had a better idea of who my classmates are as people, plus it was a fun way to start class.”'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'I continue to foster community within my collaborative classroom by having my students work with the same people each class meeting. Together, they work on multiple low stakes activities in order to construct knowledge and become comfortable with one another. Students have told me that they enjoy group work because they can test out their ideas on a small audience before presenting their ideas to the class. The comfort the students develop in their groups is particularly important when it comes time for peer response. I’ve had many students tell me they feel more comfortable sharing their ideas and providing feedback to their peers because they know who their groups members are. One student wrote specifically on this and the gains that she made academically and socially, “I liked how she made us interact in groups. For instance, we did a lot of peer review and she guided us through the process. This was helpful because it gave me feedback I wouldn’t have given to myself and it helped me come out of an introverted shell I had.”'}
          </p>
          <p>
            {'By promoting a first attempt in learning approach to teaching, I believe my students have greatly benefitted from my teaching style. My students, I believe, can offer the best perspective on the success of my teaching. One student kindly wrote, “I liked how passionate and dedicated she was to teaching us. I also thoroughly enjoyed the fact that she made the class interesting and time go by really fast by incorporating a variety of videos, music, computer, and group activities.” However, I think this student says it best: “Ellen is da bomb.”'}
