    <p>
          As a teacher, I believe that students learn best in an environment where they can feel comfortable
      being vulnerable, allowing them to actively engage in the learning process. However, composition classrooms
      can be fraught spaces for students as they engage with ideas that challenge their preconceived notions of
      writing and open their work up to feedback from both peers and the instructor. As a result, students may
      enter the writing classroom feeling particularly exposed. To account for the range of responses and students
      in my courses, I rely upon an embodied pedagogy, which emphasizes the contextual nature of the bodies and
      minds inhabiting our classrooms. A focus on embodiment asks practitioners to rethink how they approach
      their understanding of themselves and others. It asks for instructors to attend to the diverse student
      population in our classrooms by bringing attention to context, the body, and the mind and the ways in which
      they operate to make meaning. This perspective influences all aspects of my construction and movement
      within a course, including my commitment to: inclusivity, accessibility, and collaboration.
    </p>
    <h5>Inclusivity</h5>
    <p>
          Part of creating a successful course is accounting for student differences in socioeconomic
      backgrounds, race, disability status, language use, and privilege from the beginning and designing courses that
      recognize the diverse bodies and minds present in the classroom. One of the ways that I attempt to do is this
      by creating a welcoming classroom environment and addressing topics that recognize different bodies and
      minds both in and outside of the classroom space. To accomplish these goals, I use several strategies
      throughout the semester. To begin with, I start every semester with a welcome questionnaire that helps me
      get to know my students better and their unique needs as learners. On this survey, I ask students about their
      preferred pronouns, desired methods of classroom participation, concerns about the semester ahead,
      accommodations they might need during the semester, and provide them space to let me know anything else
      they think is relevant. I find this information to be vital in how I run my classroom as it provides me with
      needed insight into my audience. For example, it helps me determine who would work well together in
      collaborative groups, address and alleviate concerns regarding the course, and identify who might need
      additional support throughout the semester.
    </p>
    <p>
          Understanding my students as individuals and students does not stop after the first day. I regularly
      include practices to help me better understand my students and their needs, such as daily attendance
      questions, informal mid-term teaching evaluations, and one-on-one conferences. Every day for attendance, I
      ask my students a fun, light question, which helps build classroom rapport. My daily attendance questions are
      frequently brought up on my course evaluations, since students really appreciate the opportunity to get to
      know each other better and start the class off on a positive note. During the middle of the semester, I ask my
      students to reflect on their progress thus far and how I can better meet their needs and expectations as their
      instructor. I use this feedback to tailor the second half of the semester based on the needs of my students.
      Finally, depending on the course, I typically incorporate one to two one-on-one student conferences where I
      invite students to discuss their current project and any questions they might have. Students and I both find
      these conferences valuable as they can get needed clarity on assignments and I can evaluate, and later
      address, areas that the class needs to work on.
    </p>
    <h5>Accessibility</h5>
    <p>
          Part of recognizing and welcoming a diverse body of students means building an accessible classroom
      environment. To reach this goal, I consciously and consistently move towards broad accessibility or universal
      design for learning. Universal design for learning (UDL) is a pedagogical approach to creating courses that are
      accessible to a wide range of disabled students, without the need for accommodations. UDL resists the use of
      accommodations, since accommodations are frequently treated as retrofits. Retrofits have been described as

      forced corrections to fix an accessibility problem, that often times do not actually fix the problem. Retrofits in
      education may mean that the disabled student is still at a disadvantage, despite the attempted remedy to
      inaccessibility. Many scholars recognize that UDL is an ongoing goal, rather than a finite destination. Creating a
      classroom that is fully accessible to a diverse range of disabled students is always a work-in-progress, since
      disabilities and how people experience them are incredibly diverse. Educators can, however, take steps
      toward building an accessible learning environment. Therefore, I have structures in place that allow for a
      diverse range of students to easily navigate my classroom. Some of the tactics that I regularly employ include
      posting my lecture slides, assigning students to take notes and publicly post them on the course website,
      ensuring that all videos have closed captions, and instituting flexible classroom policies that respect students
      and their lives outside of the classroom.
    </p>
    <p>
          Creating an accessible learning environment that promotes and welcomes disability, does not end at
      implementing classroom policies. Instead, I see it as my responsibility to introduce students to relevant topics
      related to disability. For example, during my Writing and Editing for Print and Online course, I built in a service
      learning project. During this project, our class partnered with Hope Service Dogs, a nonprofit service dog
      agency, to create a variety of texts to educate the public on service dogs and promote their mission. Students
      also learned about the Americans with Disabilities Act, how service dogs can help disabled individuals, and the
      discrimination service dog handlers frequently encounter. Beyond this pertinent information, we also delved
      into how they can create multimodal texts that are accessible for a wide range of disabled viewers. They were
      able to use this knowledge to create multimodal texts that educated the public on services dogs and their
      handlers’ rights. Students, consequently, leave my classes with a greater understanding of disability and how
      to create accessible texts.
    </p>
    <h5>Collaboration</h5>
    <p>
          In recognizing the individual histories of my students as well as developing an accessible design, I
      understand that they all have rich perspectives and skills that can enhance the learning of their fellow
      classmates. By fostering collaborative learning communities, students can benefit from their ideas being
      challenged or supported by their peers and develop into stronger thinkers and writers. However, many
      students are uncomfortable with this process as much of their educational careers promote notions of
      individual success. In order to foster an environment that supports collaborative learning, I build student
      teams by intentionally placing students together who complement one another. To construct these groups, I
      rely on my students’ responses to the welcome questionnaire where they discuss their preferred methods of
      classroom engagement, their writing and work habits, and various needs as learners. I group students who
      have similar work habits and different styles of classroom participation. Students in these groups have peers
      who are comfortable engaging with the class in a variety of different contexts (e.g., someone who is willing to
      report small group discussion points to the entire class) and who approach class projects similarly (e.g., begin
      planning an assignment right away or waiting until the last day to start), which can reduce stress. This results
      in strong teams who can confidently share their ideas with one another, thus deepening their understanding
      of the course content. I frequently use these teams in my classroom to offer students low-stakes
      environments to try out new ideas and develop confidence in their understanding of the material. I find that
      by building groups this way, it fosters community, which leads to stronger classroom involvement and
      encourages students’ investment in the course.
    </p>
    <p>
          As an instructor, I am committed to developing classrooms that welcome a variety of different
      learners. By creating an accessible and inclusive environment that fosters collaborative learning, I believe that
      students can achieve educational success. Embodied pedagogy offers me a way to create courses that
      encourages a variety of learners and fosters a supportive learning community.
